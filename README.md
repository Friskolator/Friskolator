This is an open source opt-in little-brother data/privacy project.  We ask you to dump/share/show as much of your gear as you want, and we take a photo of it.  Then we process the photo, collect some (again, opt-in 'as much as you want' metada from you, and get it on the net.

After we have scads of amazingly amazing data, we'll crowdsource some stats and analytics on it.
