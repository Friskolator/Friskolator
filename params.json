While passing through our fair city, you may run into some Transit Police.  These kind folks will take you bag, swipe it for weird chemicals, and intimate you accidentally.  But don't blame them too much, they are apples in a bad (or maybe just odd) Barrel. \r\n\r\n## Friskolator\r\nBut, say they did open your bag. What would they find? Are you carrying things that are all legal? All sane? Do you have a stick of lipstick? How about a multi-tool? Some blush that is also ninja-disappearing-powerder? \r\n\r\nWe at the Friskolator welcome you to a voluntary frisking! Come drop your pants (err, well, your bag?) and show us what you are carrying around.    We'll archive it (anonymously), create some stats on it, and crowdsource some ID's from it. \r\n\r\nWhat can we discover about you from your bag?  Do you dare show your stuff, and let us catalog it? These questions and more can be answered only **by Friskolator**\r\n\r\n## Get Friskolated\r\nVisit our table/booth at Hope #9. Bring your purse, your man-bag, or whatever else you carry things in.  We'll have a photo station to take a shapshot of all of your gear laid out, pretty-like You can friskolate as much (or as little) of your gear as you want, and you can answer as much (or as little) of our QA as you want.  Then we will hit the 'enter' button, and send your gear-photo   (and your meta-data) to our software stack to crowdsorce ID your gear, and to run some awesome stats and analytics on what you carry.","name":"Friskolator"}
